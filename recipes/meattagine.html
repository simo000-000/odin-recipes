        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul><h4>
            <li>1 kilo beef, trimmed and cut into thick strips</li>
            <li>1 medium red onion</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>A little over a teaspoon each ground ginger, turmeric, and ras al hanout</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste A handful of raw almonds</li>
            <li>6 boiled prunes, plus about 75 millilitres of their syrup</li>
            <li>2 handfuls dried prunes 3 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>A generous sprinkling of cinnamon, a few cinnamon sticks, or both</li>
        </ul></h4>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol><h4>
            <li><p>Slice the red onion and arrange on the bottom of a medium sized tagine. Add the meat and sprinkle with the spices and olive oil. Cook over medium high heat for 10 minutes. Then, add enough water to cover the beef a quarter of the way up and put on the lid. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook for another hour. Check on the tagine halfway through cooking and add a bit more water if it is looking dry. Pour in about 3 tablespoons of boiled prune syrup at this point as well.</p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, blanch the almonds and fry them until golden brown, about 3-5 minutes. Then drain out any excess oil and set aside.</p></li>
            <li><p>Once the meat is done, remove the tagine from the heat and sprinkle with toasted almonds. Garnish with the prunes, and then top each one with a sprinkling of sesame seeds. Serve warm with khobz.</p></li>
            <li><p>Toss the prunes into a pan and cover completely with water. Cook over high heat until half of the water has boiled off, about 10-15 minutes. Then, add sugar and cinnamon and continue to boil for another 10 minutes until most of the water has boiled off and youâ€™re left with soft, plumped prunes in a sugary syrup. These are incredibly versatile, and can be added to anything from tagine to an ice cream sundae.</p></li>
        </ol></h4>
